1st Module Challenge Boot Camp

Most of the code was taken from actual class examples and excercises. The reset code is pretty much the same as the one given in class.

Used W3 Schools a lot. Mostly for code concerning the images (hover over and opacity, textbox over image, background image at the top, using urls for images).

The navigation in the page was thanks to CodingLab on youtube and his Simple Navigation Bar in HTML and CSS video
