# theFirstChallenge
1st Module Challenge Boot Camp

Most of the code was taken from actual class examples and excercises
Used W3 Schools a lot. Mostly for code concerning the images (hover over and opacity, textbox over image, background image at the top, using urls for images).
The navigation in the page was thanks to CodingLab on youtube and his Simple Navigation Bar in HTML and CSS video
All of the images are mine
